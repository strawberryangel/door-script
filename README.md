# Door Scripts

This has a couple of door scripts which are able to rotate around 
any arbitrary axis. 
One is for linked objects. 
The other is for root objects.

Because the axis of rotation is arbitrary, 
it doesn't need to go through the object center, 
eliminating the need for hinge objects, 
prim cutting or 
offsetting geometry. 

The axis of rotation doesn't need to be touching the object at all. 
In this case, the entire object will arc around an invisible hinge. 

**NOTE:** These scripts are not ready-to-run.
These were created as demonstrations of the process only.
